# Vyashole's dotfiles
My dev environment

1. The .vimrc does not work out of the box. Install this first: https://github.com/amix/vimrc
2. The .zshrc needs oh-my-zsh and this: https://github.com/KorvinSilver/blokkzh
3. The config files have my username slapped all over the place. So not sure how to handle that. Maybe I'll write a script to change the username.
